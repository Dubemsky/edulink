- message are encrypted and stored in database
- Bookmark : allows people to follow up with conversations
- Notifications : will show replies, tags
- schedule  session livestream and screen record. this will save it to the chats or a section called live streams
- Building and customising it. Jisti Meet for live stream  Mediastream API for screen recording and upload videos to Firebase



###### AI IMPLEMNTATION / TEXT ANALYTICS
- Smart question suggestion:
        Use a search algorithm (like fuzzy matching or full-text search) to find similar questions.
        Display top 3-5 similar questions below the input field.

- Auto-Tagging & Categorization
        Automatically assign tags based on keywords.
        Implementation:
        Use Natural Language Processing (NLP) (like Pythonâ€™s spaCy or an AI API) to extract key topics.

- Summarized Discussions
        Generate a summary of long discussions under each question.
        Implementation:
        Use AI models like GPT to summarize discussions into key takeaways.

- AI: Check if a text is a question, for monitoring convo making sure its appropriate
        hugging face text analisis and llama for text classification
